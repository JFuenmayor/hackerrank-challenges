//There are N variables and M requirements. Requirements are
//represented as (X <= Y), meaning that the x^th variable must be less
//than or equal to the y^th variable.
//
//Your task is to assign non-negative numbers smaller than 10 to each
//variable and then calculate the number of different assignments
//satisfying all requirements. Two assignments are different if and only
//if at least one variable is assigned to a different number in both
//assignments. Print your answer modulo 10^3 + 7.
